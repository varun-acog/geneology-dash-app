My dash app:

Now in the filters section, I have a dropdown above Select Product Code called "What are you looking for?" and this dropdown should have these items:

Everything went into making the Lot/Item (when this is selected, only Genealogy check box should be checked)

Link between the two Lots(when this is selected both Genealogy and Traceability checkboxes should be checked)

Where the Lot got Used/Consumed(when this is selected, only Traceability check box should be checked)

Where Used(Put it as it is for now no functionality)
